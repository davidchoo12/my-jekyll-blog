# About me
Welcome to my website! I am currently a year 4 undergraduate taking Information
Systems in National University of Singapore. I love to code. I am most confident
when working with Javascript for front and back end web development and I am
currently learning C++. I have been doing web development ever since I was back
in Singapore Polytechnic since 2014, but I am very willing to learn new
technologies.

My resume is available
[here](https://github.com/davidchoo12/Awesome-CV/blob/master/resume.pdf). Feel
free to reach me at [davidchoo16@gmail.com.](mailto:davidchoo16@gmail.com)

Even though I am an InfoSys student, I would consider myself to be more of a
Computer Science type of person. I have been taking CS modules that are not part
of my graduation requirement. I am interested in algorithmic problem solving and
machine learning.

I would usually spend my free time and holidays working on
[pet projects](/projects) that arises from my interests and needs. I have also
attended countless meetups and several hackathons to explore the tech landscape
outside of school environment. Besides coding, my hobbies include watching
anime, stargazing/astronomy, reading and cycling.

My first coding experience was writing HTML on Microsoft notepad, using the
traditional table layout technique back in 2012/13 when I was in secondary
school. Looking back, I have come a long way to become who I am today.

# FAQ

## Why did I not switch to CS back in year 1?
I was convinced that the quality of the IS and CS degrees would be the same and
it would not matter as much in the long term. I also believe I can learn CS
even without being in the CS course.

## How different is IS and CS?
CS is definitely much more technical than IS and are usually more intensive in
terms of workload. IS modules often have projects that involves web development
(IS3106, IS4100) and involves report/essay writing (IS2102, IS3103, IS4100) or
presentations (IS2101, IS3103, IS4100).

## How did I code this website?
This is a jekyll blog which I customised. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a
static site generator which makes updating and maintaining the site simple. The
code for the website is [available
here](https://github.com/davidchoo12/my-jekyll-blog).

I learnt of Jekyll and static site generators through a talk by
[Jethro](https://braindump.jethro.dev/). When designing my site, I drew
inspiration from his website, [the author of vim-plug](https://junegunn.kr/),
and [this blogpost I came
across.](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/)

Spaces! 2 spaces to be exact, but I will follow standards (eg 4 spaces for Java,
etc).
